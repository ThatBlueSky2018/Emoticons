# EmoVerse Requirement Document

## Chapter 1-Introduction:

  EmoVerse aims to provide an online platform that allows users to search, upload, and download emoticons, providing users with a wide selection of emoticons. The vision of EmoVerse is to create a space full of creativity, entertainment, and social interaction, providing convenience and fun for users.

## Chapter 2-Project Background:

  In the digital age, emoticons have become an important component of online and mobile communication. They not only provide users with a richer way to express emotions, but also enable entertainment and easy online communication. However, despite the increasingly widespread use of emoticons, finding a suitable emoticon pack is still a very difficult task. At the same time, various emoticons are scattered across different platforms and applications, and users need to switch between multiple applications to find and use emoticons, which poses some obstacles to users. In addition, many users have the desire to create their own emoticons, but lack a convenient platform to achieve this wish. That's why we decided to create EmoVerse.

  The emoticon universe not only concentrates various emoticon packages on one platform, but also provides a friendly creation and sharing environment to meet the various needs of users. We believe that EmoVerse will become an online community full of vitality, creativity, and social interaction.

  This requirement document aims to define and provide a detailed description of the functions and requirements of the EmoVerse to ensure the successful implementation of the project.
